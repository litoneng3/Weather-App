"# Weather-App" 
This is a web App for Weather information. By default it is showing the overall weather informaiton for Rajshahi District. The users can search weather information of any district by searching on top right search bar. This web app can show the almost attributes: temperatrue, max temperature, min temperature, feels like, humidity,Cloud PCT, wind speed, wind degree, sunrise time, sunset time. This web app shows the information in three cards named: Temperature, Humidity and Wind speed.In Temperature card, user will find the temperarture, min temperature, max temperature and feels like. In Humidity, users will find cloud pct and Humidity. In Wind speed card, users will find about wind speed and wind degree. 

For developing this web app, I used html:5 , bootstrap 4, jquery. For the weather information I used the api from rapid.api.
I hope, anyone can find the weather information for any districts all over the world.
Thank you.
